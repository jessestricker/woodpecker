## Development

This project is build with CMake. It uses Qt as one of its dependencies, so for
CMake to find the Qt library files, the prefix path variable must be set.  
To do that, create a file `cmake/QtEnv.cmake` and set the `QT_INSTALL_DIR`
variable there, for example:

```cmake
set(QT_INSTALL_DIR "C:/Qt/6.2.1/msvc2019_64")
```

This file is included by the main `CMakeLists.txt` and appends the Qt
installation directory to the CMake prefix path.

In addition to that, when running the executable `woodpecker_app.exe` on
Windows, you need to set the `PATH` variable to include `${QT_INSTALL_DIR}/bin`
directory. Unfortunately, this can not be done via CMake, instead set this in
your IDE when debugging. For example, in CLion this can be set in the
*Environment* configuration field in the *Run Configurations*.
